* Updated mod to 1.19.3
* Fixed piglins "juggling" and destroying items
* Code has been rewritten to *hopefully* cause less bugs in the future
* Temporarily changed "enchanting" setting to be *false* by default

Known issue: ["enchanting" causes unintentional behaviour with villager trades or when enchanting tools](https://github.com/WerDei/Server-Hats/issues/5)
