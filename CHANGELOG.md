* Configuration options now can be changed in-game using a command: `/hats <option> <value>`, or just viewed with `/hats <option>`
* When `"enchanting"` is set to `true`, allowed items can now be enchanted (on an anvil) with helmet-specific enchantments like Respiration
* Items that already have an equipment slot assigned to them (armor, elytra, etc...) can now be allowed and worn as a hat
