* Configuration options now can be changed in-game using a command: `/hats set <option>`
  * Additionally, items can be added to the allowed list with `/hats allow <item>` and removed with `/hats disallow <item>`
* When `"enchanting"` is set to `true`, allowed items can now be enchanted (on an anvil) with helmet-specific enchantments like Respiration
* Items that already have an equipment slot assigned to them (armor, elytra, etc...) can now be allowed and worn as a hat
* Mobs that can pick up loot will no longer equip allowed items on their heads
