* Configuration options now can be changed in-game using a command: `/hats set <option>`
* Items that already have an equipment slot assigned to them (armor, elytra, etc...) can now be allowed and worn as a hat
* When `"enchanting"` is set to `true`, allowed items can now be enchanted (on an anvil) with helmet-specific enchantments like Respiration 
* Mobs that can pick up loot won't equip allowed items on their heads
