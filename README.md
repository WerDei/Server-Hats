# Server Hats
Server-side Fabric mod that allows players equip items as hats.  
To equip an allowed item, simply put it in the helmet slot - no commands necessary!  
Requires Fabric API  

## Configuration
The mod is very customizable, making it easy to tune it to your preference.

By default, mod allows players to equip some items that have special rendering rules in vanilla Minecraft:
* Banners
* Fence gates
* Amethyst clusters and buds
* Feather
* End rod
* Lightning Rod
* Spyglass

And some other ones I thought looked cool\funny:
* Glass blocks (including tinted and stained glass)
* Azalea bushes
* Scaffolding
* Big dripleaf
* Slime and honey blocks
* Composter

You can add/remove any items to/from this list. You can also make it so any item in the game can be used as a hat!

These items can also be equipped to players with a dispenser and can be enchanted with curse enchantments on an anvil (for when you want to test your frienships).

Shift-clicking these items will not equip them - that way players won't accidentially end up with their building blocks on their heads.

You can tweak all of those features using a configuration file:

## Known issues
* While in multiplayer, players in creative mode cannot equip items to a helmet slot
