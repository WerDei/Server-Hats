# Server Hats
Server-side Fabric mod that allows players equip items as hats.  
To equip an allowed item, simply put it in the helmet slot - no commands necessary!  
The mod is very customizable, making it easy to tune it to your preference.

Requires Fabric API  

## Features
By default, mod allows players to equip most items that have special rendering rules in vanilla Minecraft:
* Banners
* Fence gates
* Amethyst clusters and buds
* Beds
* Feather
* End rod
* Lightning Rod
* Spyglass
* Lead
* Bone
* Cod
* Conduit

And some other ones I thought looked cool\funny:
* Glass blocks (including tinted and stained glass)
* Azalea bushes
* Scaffolding
* Big dripleaf
* Slime and honey blocks
* Composter

You can add/remove any items to/from this list. You can also make it so any item in the game can be used as a hat!

These items can also be equipped to players with a dispenser and can be enchanted with curse enchantments on an anvil (for when you want to test your friendships).
You can also enchant items with helmet enchantments like Respiration!

Shift-clicking these items will not equip them - that way players won't accidentally end up with their building blocks on their heads.

You can tweak all of those features using a `/hats` command, or a configuration file. You can read more here:

## Known issues
* While in multiplayer, players in creative mode cannot equip allowed items to a helmet slot
* ["enchanting" setting causes unintentional behaviour with villager trades or when enchanting tools](https://github.com/WerDei/Server-Hats/issues/5)

## Found a bug?
Please consider reporting it [on GitHub](https://github.com/WerDei/Server-Hats/issues) instead of in the comments, I'm way more likely to notice it there.
